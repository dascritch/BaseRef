Base Ref
========
Utilities to transcode a integer from and to base 10 to a alphanumerical base where the handwritten numbers won't have potential homoglyphes. It was first developed in a defunct service called “dAgence” as base 33 for generating command references, hence the “base ref” name.
It is actually a base 28.

This project is just an exercice (TDD and implementation in numerous languages), but you can use it and fork it. A work-in-progress (french written) post will be published during autumn 2014.

But if you find it really useful, I'll be happy.

Blogged about it there (in French):

1. [Relire un numéro de commande écrit à la main](http://dascritch.net/post/2014/09/23/BaseRef-1-comment-relire-le-num%C3%A9ro-de-commande-%C3%A9crit-%C3%A0-la-main)

Principles
----------
The “conventionnal” base 36 uses numbers then letters : `0123456789ABCDEFHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`

I'm removing any letter that may be confused with numbers when (badly) handwritten :`BGILOSYZ`

We have 28 available glyphes : `0123456789ACDEFHJKMNPQRTUVWX`

Do you read E55S or EGGS ? https://twitter.com/ldodds/status/492965240657944576

Intentions
----------
* Coding rules are : TDD, DRY, safe
* Is it possible to do TDD in various languages with only one specification file ?
* Do tests suite have different behaviours ?
* What language is smartest to read afterwards ?
* Ok, it's OOP, but have we smartests patterns ?
* How Json is decoded ?

API
---
The class should implements :

* `isValid`(string)
 * true : if a string has the glyphes even lowercase or a empty string
 * false  : elsewhere
* `encode`(absolute integer)
 * string : the translated string
 * false : if not an absolute integer, like real or negative numbers or NaN
* `decode`(string)
 * integer : the transcoded number
 * false : if not translatable
It may have an `exception` for debug purposes

Implementations
---------------
* Javascript (with QUnit and Jasmine)
* Python 3
* PHP (with Atoum)
* Ruby 1.9.3
* C#
